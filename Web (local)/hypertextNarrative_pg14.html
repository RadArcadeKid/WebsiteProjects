			<h3>
				Inside the Temple
			</h3>
			<p>
			I'm in a large room that makes up most of the temple. The wooden walls are tall and illuminated by lanterns. A small bowl of water sits in the center of the room. <br><br> 
						This place is...empty? There’s no one here. <br><br>
			Have I really traveled all this way for an empty temple? For nothing? <br> 
			I walk up to the bowl, stare into the water and look at my reflection...<br><br>
			<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg15.html">...and that’s when it hits me.</a><br>
