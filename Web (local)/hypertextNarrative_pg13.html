				Entrance to the Temple
			</h3>
			<p>
			The temple is massive. It has an old cherry-red paint seems untouched by snow. The walls come together in ornate patterns. <br> It appears to be mostly dark, and itâ€™s oddly quiet. <br><br>The air is still. The snow stops falling. <br>Perhaps whoever is inside could be meditating?
