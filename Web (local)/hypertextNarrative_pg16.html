			<h3>
				Epilogue
			</h3>
			<p>
				The sound of birds chirping wake me up. <br>
				I slowly get up from my bed, feeling refreshed...<br><br>
				...not just from sleep, but from the beauty of daily life. The uncertainty of what's ahead <br> 
				<br>
				I find a quarter on the ground, and pick it up. 
				<br><br>
				I'm not sure where my next adventure will take me, but I feel this one is complete<br><br>
