			<h3>
				Night
			</h3>
			<p>
				I stay on the train until night. <br>
				The thick darkness outside envelops the trees. The stars twinkle, and the moon skims accross the horizon <br>
				<br>
				I thought the train was empty....but I just realized - <br> at the last stop, a mysterious stranger with a small box had boarded. Who is he? <br><br>

				<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg6.html">I feel like I should talk to him...</a> <br>
