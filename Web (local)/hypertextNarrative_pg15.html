				Realization
			</h3>
			<p>
			It’s...me...!<br><br> I think... <b><i>I am the wise person in the temple.</i></b> <br><br>
			All the talk of an enlightened one, who truly understands what makes life wonderful...<br>It's me. I’ve traveled so far to find some sense of happiness and passion out of life, but it had never occured to me that I found it in every step of the journey. <br> I feel happier and wiser not from some ancient wisdom or mysterious power in a temple, but rather, through my discoveries, and appreciation of all of the little moments and exchanges on this journey. <br>
			<br> I think understand now <br><br>

			I smile, sit, and quietly reflect.
