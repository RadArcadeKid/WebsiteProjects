			<h3>
				A Polite Exchange
			</h3>
			<p>
				I politely refuse the tea. <br> He nods. <br> <q>All good</q> he says, <q>You know what you like and don’t like, which makes life better. That’s important – you gotta be confident in decisions like that, even if they’re seemingly trivial</q> <br><br>
				He asks me who I am. I tell him I’m looking for an enlightened master found in a mysterious temple on a mountain.  <br>I feel compelled to ask the old man a question.

				<br><br>
				<q>You seem wise,</q> I say, <a href="hypertextNarrative_pg9.html"><q>Do you know anything about this temple?</q></a><br>
