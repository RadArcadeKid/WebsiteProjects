			<h3>
				New Paths...
			</h3>
			<p>
				I go to the train station. The afternoon air is sweet.
				<br> I buy a ticket to the farthest stop possible, way out past the edge of town, and board the small car. 
				<br>...<br>
				Trees speed past the train car, and the daylight shimmers through the large glass windows. I’ve never realized how beautiful this place looks until now. <br>
				I’m not sure if I should <br> <br>
				<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg4.html">get off at the next stop</a> <br> 
				or <br>
				<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg5.html">stay on the train until night.</a>
