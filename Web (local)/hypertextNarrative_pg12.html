				Beauty of the Skies
			</h3>
			<p>
			The moon brightly illuminates the entire mountain. <br> Stars twinkle gently, and light up the scene. <br> I breathe in the fresh winter air. The snow tickles down <br> 
			Lately, I haven't stopped to appreciate this kind of thing anymore. I’ve been so caught up with life that I don’t take the time to notice the small things that make me happy. <br><br>
			I see the outline of a temple in the distance - <br><br>

			<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg13.html">Should I continue towards the temple?</a><br><br>
			<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg11.html">Or stay and admire the trees?</a><br>
