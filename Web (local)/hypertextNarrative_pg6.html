			<h3>
				A Kind Old Man 
			</h3>
			<p>
				Illuminated by the dim light inside the train car, I walk over to talk to him. The atmosphere is friendly. <br> The smell of green tea overwhelms the car. <br><br> The old man smiles at me. He appears to have a small tea kettle with him, as is sipping tea from a cup. <br> I greet him, and he offers me a seat. <br><br>
				He asks me â€“ <br>
				<q>Would you like some tea?</q> <br><br>

				<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg7.html"><q>Yes, please</q></a>       
				<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg8.html"><q>No, thank you</q></a><br>
