				Beauty of the Trees
			</h3>
			<p>
			The trees are massive and heavily blanketed with snow. The wind has settled, but little snowflakes still fall. The snow sparkles in the trees. <br>
			They remind me of all the friends I have back home. Sure, life can be a little dull, but my friends will always be there. <br> Have I really never noticed the beauty of life in moments like this? <br><br> 
			I see the outline of a temple in the distance - <br><br>

			<a href="hypertextNarrative_pg12.html">Or stay and admire the sky?</a><br>
