					This is Daft Punk during their Alive 2007 tour. This was their most recent (and perhaps last?) tour that the group went on. 
				</p>

				<h4>A music video for the group's hit song, <i>Human After All</i></h4>

				<p>
					While this isn't the official video for their song, it's a well-made fan video spliced together of clips from their film, <i>Electroma</i>, which 
					in my own opinion, fits together really nicely and tells the story of both the film and the song in a really brilliant way.

					A mix of Daft Punk's <i>Around the world/ Harder Better Faster Stronger</i>, played during their <i>Alive</i> tour. 
					I really wish I could've seen them at this tour, they would've been a really solid performance, especially in their early days

					Maps of Daft Punk's Tour
				</h2>
				<p>
					These are maps from Daft Punk's <i>Alive 2007</i>, which lasted from April 2006 until December, 2007. The tour was exclusive to Daft Punk, and the group played remixes of their older and (at the time) newer work from their first few studio albums. In almost all venues, they played inside <a href="https://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/2006/08/leds-create-pyramid-showcase-for-daft-punk.html">a giant pyramid with LED's around it</a>, similar to what many modern DJ's like DeadMau5 currently use. This was one of their most inconic tours, and quite possibly their last. This is due to both their age as a group and lack of new albums.

				<h2>
					More Info 
				</h2>
				<p>
					Daft Punk, as a group, are just as prolific and exciting as they are mysterious and facination. They've played around the world on their live shows, but unfortunately, it looks like they don't plan on putting out many more tours. Given that their last one was over a decade ago, and that both members are 46, it doesn't seem like they plan on doing a massive tour anytime soon.
					<br>
					Surprisngly, though, they did do a recent colaboration with an artist known as THE WEEKND, and helped to make the beats for the background of his song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFLhGq0060w"><i>I Feel It Coming</i></a>. This was their first release in over six years, and even though it wasn't a studio album, it perhaps could be the start of something greater. Maybe even another tour?
