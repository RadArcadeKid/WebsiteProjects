			<h3>
				The Stranger
			</h3>
			<p>
				The train reaches a stop in town. A vibrant orange sunset streaks the sky <br> 
				<br>Somehow, I feel like this just isnâ€™t the place for me...<br>Just before I decide to leave, I look outside to see a mysterious old stranger with a small box getting on the train. <br><br>
				He gives me a polite nod, and he sits down in the back of the car in silence.
				<br><br> He and I are now the only two passengers. We wait until the sky turns dark. <br><br>
