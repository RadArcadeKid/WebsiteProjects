			<h3>
				Tea with a New Friend 
			</h3>
			<p>
				He pours me some of his tea. It’s delicious. <br> I’d never realized how much I really enjoyed the sweet taste of tea. I thank him, and he nods. <br><br>
				<q>You gotta learn to appreciate the small things,</q> he says. <q>The beauty of tiny special moments in life.</q> <br>
				He asks me who I am. I tell him I’m looking for an enlightened master found in a mysterious temple on a mountain. <br> The old man smiles a knowing smile when I mention this. 
				<br><br>
				<q>You seem wise,</q> I say, <a href="hypertextNarrative_pg9.html"><q>Do you know anything about this temple?</q></a> <br>
