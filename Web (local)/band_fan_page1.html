			<b><i> Who is Daft Punk? </i></b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Daft Punk is a French musician duo who have been producing electronic music since the late 1990's. They are made up of two members, Guy-Manuel De Homo Cristo, and Thomas Bangalter. Both members wear iconic gold and silver robot masks, and very few photos of their actual faces exist. They even wear these masks at live shows, and don't even take them off for interviews, adding to their mysteriousness and enigmatic presence. 
			The two have been making music since they were 14, and their style has shifted drastically throughout the years. Despite this, they are considered one of the biggest pioneers of French house music, and have sold millions of copies of their albums. Their first studio album, <i>Homework</i> was released on Virgin Records in 1997. It was this album that set them up for fame, and from there, they became a global sensation.

			<b><i> Where have they been? </i></b>
			<br>
			<br>
			The group originally started playing live shows throughout France, however, once they started gaining a worldwide following, they eventually began to go global with their tours. The major tour they had was known as Alive 2007, where they toured most of the world! 
			Daft Punk has also made many appearances on the radio throughout the years, most recently with their album <i>Random Access Memories</i>. They have also made cameo appearances in several films, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy"><i>TRON: Legacy</i></a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstella_5555:_The_5tory_of_the_5ecret_5tar_5ystem"><i>Intersella: 5555</i></a>, both of which they produced the soundtrack for. Daft Punk even directed, stared in, and produced their own full-length film, entitled <q><i>Daft Punk's Electroma</i></q>. The imdb page for it can be found <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800022/">here.</a>
			The group also had a cameo as playable characters in the 2009 cross-platform video game <i>DJ Hero</i>, and several remixes of their songs were featured in the game.
